Now that I have your attention, let me calm things down. Dont worry, Hawaii is NEVER that bad so the worst of it is still quite enjoyable. But its important to look at the data being the weather patterns of the area to help you prepare/plan for your visit. 

## How much does it rain per year?

Hawaii has a tropical climate with average summer temperate at 88F and winter temperature around at 76F. Being close to the tropics, Hawaii gets a large total volume of rainfall per year but because of its equatorial nature and size, at a certain time, you may face pleasant moderating surfing weather or heavy rain storms straight out of Blade Runner.
